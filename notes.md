- For DeclId, either start with "let/var/val/..." or have to say type. 
  - Otherwise we can't tell the diff b/w declaration and assignment
  - ^^^ We have this already
- subscripted-expression.js
  - add is list or dictionary
  - var variable type = types of list/dict
  - dict: check the value of key and value
  - Check type of key, value and match with type of instantiated key, value dict
  - import ListType and DictType to subscripted-expression
